* Introduction
This is a mashup of Pavel Korlev's (borodust) aw-skia, the skia parts in alien-works and McCLIM.

* Skia/Lisp type puns
| Skia Type | Decayed C type | Lisp cffi type |
|-----------+----------------+----------------|
| SkColor   | uint32_t       | u32            |
| SkColor4f | array-of-float | f32 x 4        |
