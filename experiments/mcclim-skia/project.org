* Introduction
This is a mashup of Pavel Korlev's (borodust) aw-skia, the skia parts in alien-works and McCLIM.

* Skia/Lisp type puns
| Skia Type | Decayed C type                                     | Lisp cffi type |
|-----------+----------------------------------------------------+----------------|
| SkColor   | uint32_t 32-bit ARGB color value, unpremultiplied. | u32            |
| SkColor4f | array-of-float                                     | f32 x 4        |
| SkPoint   | 32-bit floating point coordinates                  | f32x2          |

** Skia Notes
*** Skia Orientation
From SkM44 docs:
Skia assumes a right-handed coordinate system: +X goes to the right +Y goes down +Z goes into the screen (away from the viewer)
