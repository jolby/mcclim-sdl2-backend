** Concepts
*** Cyclical Loop with discrete processing steps
*** Each loop epoch has a time budget
*** Every loop processing step also has a time budget
** Features
*** Instrumentation from the beginning.
**** Log times, collect aggregate stats
**** Log anomolous events, steps that go over time budget
